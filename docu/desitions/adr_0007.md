## Context
<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
following the code flow is often hard and because it is c code memory leaks and corruption are easy to encounter.

## Desition
<!-- a bland statement of the desition done using the [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) standardiced vocabular. the ruling SHALL be stated in an assertive voice. -->
all functions SHALL take a `ITrace` object and SHALL state what it intents to do next to the trace. only small functions without substantial logic MAY chose to not have tracing. this SHOULD be avoided.

## Justification
<!-- a sound reasoning why this desition is taken and not another one. Any revision of the ADR MUST take the justification into seriouce consideration. -->
this gives the programmer a better understanding of the current state of the system and the flow that lead to a Problem. this can additionaly be used for logging which may be the only way to properly debug an issue a Stackholder is running into.
