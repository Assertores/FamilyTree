## Context
<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
the potentialy most voletile part of the project is it's relyence on operating system calls to read in files and present images as well as audio. all ready at the time this was written windows, mac and linux exist. it is very unclear how this well develop in the future and how backwards compatible these future operating systems will be.

## Desition
<!-- a bland statement of the desition done using the [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) standardiced vocabular. the ruling SHALL be stated in an assertive voice. -->
all OS calls SHALL be abstracted behind an `IPlatform` interface that MAY be injected by the user.

## Justification
<!-- a sound reasoning why this desition is taken and not another one. Any revision of the ADR MUST take the justification into seriouce consideration. -->
this not only makes it easyer for maintainers to extend the amount of platforms the project can be compiled for, the injection in particular makes it possible for users to intercept certain calls like showing pictures and handle them themselfs. a UI application may chose to show the images inside the application or may chose to impliment it's own audio player.
for the rare case that the reading in of data is incompatable in the future to how it is done at the time of writing, having an interface will alow users to write an adapter that makes it posible to read from any type of storage medium.
