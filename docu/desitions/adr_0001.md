## Context
<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
the project needs to make a desition on the programming language it is build in.

## Desition
<!-- a bland statement of the desition done using the [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) standardiced vocabular. the ruling SHALL be stated in an assertive voice. -->
all library code SHALL be written in C99.

## Justification
<!-- a sound reasoning why this desition is taken and not another one. Any revision of the ADR MUST take the justification into seriouce consideration. -->
the white spreddness of c makes it very likly to survive for a very long time. c compilers have also been archived in e.g. githubs `Arctic Code Vault` and other long lasting mediums. additionaly to that, the syntax of c is so strait forward that writing a new c compiler without any additional information is duable (in opposition to e.g. c++ compilers). and if no thing of that is true anymore a scilled programmer should be able to transscripe the c code into a more modern language.
