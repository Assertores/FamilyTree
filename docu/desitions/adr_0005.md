## Context
<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
a lot of the problems solved in this project where already solved befor in other libraries. adding them as dependencies and relying on there existence risks to not be compilable anymore once the dependencie is gone.

## Desition
<!-- a bland statement of the desition done using the [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) standardiced vocabular. the ruling SHALL be stated in an assertive voice. -->
no external code SHALL be used in the Library target.

## Justification
<!-- a sound reasoning why this desition is taken and not another one. Any revision of the ADR MUST take the justification into seriouce consideration. -->
this project can not assume any of the current infrastructure to still be there once it is compiled. any reference into the web (like submodules or any other dependencie manager) have to be avoided at any cost.
