## Context
<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
achiving thread safty is very hard. users may also want to talk to the api for different things which may involentarely influence the result of other api calls.

## Desition
<!-- a bland statement of the desition done using the [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) standardiced vocabular. the ruling SHALL be stated in an assertive voice. -->
all data SHALL be ultimatifly stored in the context.

## Justification
<!-- a sound reasoning why this desition is taken and not another one. Any revision of the ADR MUST take the justification into seriouce consideration. -->
burdening the threadsaftiness onto the user is way easyer as he has access to a more higher level language then c.
to also give the user the abilitie to properly encapsulate different flows from each other the implimentation must store it's data in a corresponding handler.
having a context object for an API also seams to be a very common pattern in API design.
