## Context
<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
this project is targeted to be shelved for decades and still be reasonable easy to get running again.
a lot of hooks and adjustment points are required to allow future users to customice the behaviour in the nesseary way.

## Desition
<!-- a bland statement of the desition done using the [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) standardiced vocabular. the ruling SHALL be stated in an assertive voice. -->
the creation of the API context SHALL allow the user to inject own implimentations of as many subsystems as possible.
the API MAY come with sensible defaults.

## Justification
<!-- a sound reasoning why this desition is taken and not another one. Any revision of the ADR MUST take the justification into seriouce consideration. -->
in the rare case that only the compiled library survives but not the sorcecode this can extend the livetime of the project.
if a user is unable to change the code for what ever reason this can also aid into him still being able to use the project.
