## Context
<!-- What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change? -->
the api is reaching a considerable size and not all behaviour of the api is imediately clear. to make integration of this api easyer and give future maintianers an idea about the intended behavour of the apis, a API documentation must be added.

## Desition
<!-- a bland statement of the desition done using the [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) standardiced vocabular. the ruling SHALL be stated in an assertive voice. -->
all public interfaces of the library SHALL be documented in Doxygen format.

## Justification
<!-- a sound reasoning why this desition is taken and not another one. Any revision of the ADR MUST take the justification into seriouce consideration. -->
the Doxygen format is widly spread and understood by many IDEs. the syntax is human readable and uses very little amount of decorations. most of doxygens keywords are self explanatory and can be reasoned about even without knowing the doxygen syntax at all.
