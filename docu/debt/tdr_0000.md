## Symptoms
<!-- Observable signs indicating the presence of the technical debt (e.g., frequent bugs, slow performance). -->
the lack of examples.

## Context
<!-- Detailed background information, including why the debt was incurred (e.g., rushed deadlines, outdated technologies). -->
up to now there where no Technical debt records at all. a desition was made to add TDRs to the repository to keep track of shortcuts taken. this obviasly gave rise to the issue of not having any examples showing how such a TDR could look like.

## Impact
<!-- How the debt affects system performance, scalability, maintainability, etc. -->
no one knows how to correctly write a TDR.

## Cost of Delay
<!-- Consequences of postponing the resolution of the debt. -->
having no example runs the risk to inconsistent ways how TDRs are written.

## Solution
<!-- action or strategie taken to resolve the debt. -->
to avoid this an example is beeing provided to show how TDRs are intended to be used.

<!-- ## Justification
must be filled in `Rejected` state-->
<!-- explanation why this is not a technical depth or why it needs to stay (e.g., is depended on by ..., is there for securety of ...). -->
