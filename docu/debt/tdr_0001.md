## Symptoms
<!-- Observable signs indicating the presence of the technical debt (e.g., frequent bugs, slow performance). -->
in the `data.json` for personal information there is a spelling mistake in the key `PlaceOfResidence\EndData`. it should be `EndDate` (note the last character beeing a `a` instead of an `e`).

## Context
<!-- Detailed background information, including why the debt was incurred (e.g., rushed deadlines, outdated technologies). -->
while the template for the `data.json` was created, a spelling mistake sliped through. this spelling mistake was then coppied over into the parsing step of `json_person.c`. the template was simultaniasly given out to a Stakeholder who started creating data with the spelling mistake in the key.

## Impact
<!-- How the debt affects system performance, scalability, maintainability, etc. -->
the longer this not fixed the more data is created with the wrong key and needs to be changed.

## Cost of Delay
<!-- Consequences of postponing the resolution of the debt. -->
once to much data is created a tool needs to be written to fix it in the data.

once we are not in control of all data the spelling mistake MUST be supported forever.

<!-- ## Solution
must be filled in `Resolved` state-->
<!-- action or strategie taken to resolve the debt. -->

<!-- ## Justification
must be filled in `Rejected` state-->
<!-- explanation why this is not a technical depth or why it needs to stay (e.g., is depended on by ..., is there for securety of ...). -->
